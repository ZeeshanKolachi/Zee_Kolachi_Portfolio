# ZEEKOLACHI — Personal Portfolio

A premium, dark "AI control-room" portfolio for **Zeeshan Ahmed Kolachi** — Agentic AI Architect (in training), Data Science practitioner, and primary school teacher.

Built with **Next.js 16 · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS v4 · Motion (Framer Motion)**.

## ✨ What's inside

- **Cinematic split hero** — identity + a "mission dashboard" of honest, CV-backed stats (years of experience, top AI-module grade, latest milestone, project count, social presence).
- **Active Orbit** — social links + an animated strip of real credential stats (no fabricated traffic numbers).
- **Intelligence Dossier** — skills, an experience timeline, and an achievements grid.
- **Training & Clearance** — education, certifications, and languages (from the CV).
- **Case Files** — interactive project cards that expand into full challenge → process → result stories, with optional GitHub/live-demo links + a "More on GitHub" CTA.
- **Open Channel** — a working contact form (Formspree, with a prefilled-email fallback) plus WhatsApp, email, and CV download.
- **AI Assistant** — a real **Gemini-powered** assistant (server-side, key never exposed) that answers questions from the CV and jumps to relevant sections. Falls back automatically to a built-in scripted assistant if the API is unavailable.
- **Share-ready** — an auto-generated Open Graph / Twitter card image for clean link previews.
- Mobile-first, accessible (skip link, focus states, reduced-motion support), and SEO-ready (metadata, JSON-LD, sitemap, robots).

## ✏️ Edit your content (one place)

**Everything** the site shows lives in [`content/site.ts`](content/site.ts). Open it and edit the plain data — no need to touch components.

To strengthen it over time:

- **Projects** (`projects`) — the 3 case studies are real and honest. Add a `repo` (GitHub) and/or `demo` (live) URL to any one to reveal its links, and flesh out the challenge/process/result as you ship more.
- **Socials** (`socials`) — add Facebook / X / YouTube URLs and flip `active: true`. The `metric` field is a short honest descriptor, not a follower count.
- **Credential stats** (`credentialStats`) — the hero/Orbit numbers; keep them accurate as you earn more.
- **CV** — already wired to `public/cv/Zeeshan_Ahmed_Kolachi_CV.pdf`. Replace that file to update.
- **Photo (optional)** — drop a headshot at `public/profile.jpg`.
- **Testimonials** — intentionally removed until you have real quotes. When you do, ask and it can be re-added as a section.

## 🤖 AI Assistant (Gemini)

The assistant is **live** and powered by Google Gemini, running **server-side** so the API key is never exposed to the browser.

- **Config:** `.env.local` holds `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_MODEL` (default `gemini-2.5-flash`). This file is gitignored — see `.env.example`.
- **Route:** [`app/api/assistant/route.ts`](app/api/assistant/route.ts) builds the request; the system prompt + knowledge come from your CV via `lib/assistant.ts` (`SYSTEM_PROMPT`).
- **Guardrails:** it only answers from your profile data and declines off-topic questions.
- **Fallback:** if the key is missing or the API errors, it silently falls back to the built-in scripted assistant — the site never breaks.

> ⚠️ If your key was ever shared publicly, rotate it at
> [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and update `.env.local`.

## 📨 Contact form (Formspree)

The contact form works out of the box: with no config it opens a prefilled email; once you add a free [Formspree](https://formspree.io) form, it submits in-page with a success state.

- Create a form at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io), copy its id (the part after `/f/`).
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ID` in `.env.local` (see `.env.example`) and in your host's env vars.

## 🔌 Optional integrations to add later

| Feature | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Real visitor analytics | add `@vercel/analytics` in `app/layout.tsx` | Honest numbers once you have traffic. |
| Social feeds | `components/Orbit.tsx` | GitHub/YouTube have free APIs; LinkedIn/Instagram restrict theirs. |

The UI stays the same — you only change the data source.

## 🌐 Deploy (recommended: Vercel)

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Import it at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → it auto-detects Next.js, no config.
3. In Vercel → **Settings → Environment Variables**, add `GEMINI_API_KEY` (and optionally `GEMINI_MODEL`). The assistant needs this in production.
4. Add your custom domain in Vercel's **Domains** settings and point your DNS there.
5. Update `seo.url` in `content/site.ts` to your final domain.

> Note: because the assistant uses a server API route, deploy to a platform that runs Node (Vercel, Netlify, a VPS) — not pure static hosting. Everything else on the site is static.

Free tier covers a personal portfolio comfortably and includes HTTPS + a global CDN.

## 🎨 Design tokens

Colors, fonts, glass/glow effects, and animations are defined in [`app/globals.css`](app/globals.css) (electric blue, neon green, silver on a deep void background; Fraunces serif + Inter sans).

<summary><strong>Original creative brief (vision)</strong></summary>

Create a premium personal portfolio website that feels like a living AI control room rather than a normal portfolio: a cinematic split-screen hero, a dynamic mission dashboard, an immersive scroll narrative with progressive disclosure, an achievements timeline like an intelligence dossier, project case studies that expand into full stories, a testimonials signal board, a confident contact CTA with downloadable CV, and an elegant, non-intrusive AI assistant — dark, high-contrast, electric blue / neon green / silver, with editorial serif + clean sans, glassmorphism, soft glow, subtle motion, fast, mobile-first, accessible, and SEO-friendly.
